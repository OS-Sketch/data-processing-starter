"""Perform data processing using cron jobs implemented in Python."""

# TODO: Add all of the required imports


# TODO: Implement the following features:
#
# 1) Delete all of the files in the data/ directory before execution
# 2) Run a data generation task that will create audio file data and save it to a CSV file
# 3) Run a data summarization task that will summarize audio file data and save it to a CSV file
# 4) Parse the command-line arguments to the program and configure the data processor
# 5) Display diagnostic information about all of the provided command-line arguments
# 6) Display timestamped information about how the program runs the generation and summarization tasks
# 7) Do not display a stack trace if a person types CTRL-c and exit with a zero exit code
# 8) Produce a zero exit code in all cases in which the program runs to completion without error
# 9) Produces a non-zero exit code only in cases when, for instance, it experiences corrupted files
# 10) Runs correctly in a virtual environment called venv that contains all of its dependencies

# TODO: review the content in the README.md file for additional details about this project
